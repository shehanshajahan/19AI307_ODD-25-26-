## AIM:
To write a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a for loop.


## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program and read an integer n from the user.

2. Initialize a variable factorial to 1 to store the result.

3. Use a for loop from 1 to n, multiplying factorial by the loop counter in each iteration.

4. After the loop ends, print the value of factorial as the factorial of n.

5. Stop the program.

```

## SOURCE CODE:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FactorialCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();  
        long factorial = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is: " + factorial);
    }
}
```





## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
The program successfully computes and displays the factorial value of the entered number.
